I was pointed to here, GitHub, when I sent an email to SmallBASIC wishing to add code to their libary.
Chris added my, First Factors MGA.bas for me then gave me a link to it.
I had never seen GitHub before but Chris asked me if it were better than SmallBASIC forum.
So here I am checking it out.

Wow things have sure changed since BASIC coding of 90's.
